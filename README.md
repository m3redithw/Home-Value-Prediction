**Customer churn** is one of the most important metrics for a growing business to evaluate. It's easier to save an existing customer before they leave than to convice them to come back. Understanding and preventing customer churn is critial to company's **long-term success**.

In this project, we will use statistical testing to analyze the key factors of customers who are more likely to churn, develop a classification model to predict churn based on those factors, and provide recommendations for retaining customers as well as predictions of churn for a list of customers (delivered via csv).
## :chart:   Business Goals
- Construct an ML Regression model that predict **propery tax assessed values** ('taxvaluedollarcnt') of Single Family Properties using attributes of the properties.

- Find the key drivers of property value for **single family properties**. Some questions that come to mind are: Why do some properties have a much higher value than others when they are located so close to each other? Why are some properties valued so differently from others when they have nearly the same physical attributes but only differ in location? Is having 1 bathroom worse than having 2 bedrooms?

- Deliver a report that the data science team can read through and replicate, understand what steps were taken, why and what the outcome was.

- Make recommendations on what works or doesn't work in prediction these homes' values.

## :memo:   Initial Questions
- Which variables are associated with churn?

- Are average monthly charges higher for customers who churn?

- Are tenure shorter for customer who churn?

- Are additional services independent with churn?
## :open_file_folder:   Data Dictionary
**Variable** |    **Value**    | **Meaning**
---|---|---
*Contract Type* | 1) Month-to-month 2) One year 3) Two year| This indicates what type of contract the customer has

## :placard:    Process
#### :one:   Data Acquisition

<details>
<summary> Gather data from mySQL database</summary>

- Create env.py file to establish connection to mySQL server

- Use **telco_churn** database in the mySQL server

- Write query to join useful tables to gather all data about the customers:  <u>customers, contract_types, payment_types, internet_service_types </u>
     ```sh
     SELECT * FROM customers JOIN contract_types USING (contract_type_id) JOIN payment_types ON customers.payment_type_id = payment_types.payment_type_id JOIN internet_service_types ON customers.internet_service_type_id = internet_service_types.internet_service_type_id
     ```
</details>

<details>
<summary> acqure.py</summary>

- Create acquire.py and user-defined function `get_telco_data()` to gather data from mySQL
     ```sh
     def get_telco_data():
     
     if os.path.isfile('telco.csv'):
        df = pd.read_csv('telco.csv', index_col=0)
    else:
        df = new_telco_data()
        df.to_csv('telco.csv')
        
    return df
    ```
- Import [acquire.py](acquire.py)

- Test acquire function

- Calling the function, and store the table in the form of dataframe
    ```sh
    df = acquire.get_telco_data()
    ```
</details>

#### :two:   Data Preparation

<details>
<summary> Data Cleaning</summary>

- **Missing values: null values are dropped** (total_charges)
     ```sh
    df['total_charges'] = df['total_charges'].str.strip()
    df = df[df.total_charges != '']
    ```
- **Data types: object is converted to the numeric datatype** (total_charges)
     ```sh
     df['total_charges'] = df.total_charges.astype(float)
     ```
- **Dummy variables: created dummy variables for binary and non-binary categorical variables**

- **Duplicate columns: duplicated columns are dropped**

- Create function `prep_telco` to clean and prepare data with steps above

- Import [prepare.py](prepare.py)

- Test prepare function

- Call the function, and store the cleaned data in the form of dataframe
</details>

<details>
<summary> Data Splitting</summary>

- Create function `split_telco_data()` to split data into **train, validate, test**

- Test prepare function

- Check the size of each dataset
     ```sh
     train.shape, validate.shape, test.shape
     ```
- Call the function, and store the 3 data samples separately in the form of dataframe
     ```sh
     train, validate, test = prepare.split_telco_data(df)
     ```
</details>

#### :three:   Exploratory Analysis
- Ask questions to find what are the key variables that are driving the churn

- Gather and sort churn rate from each driver into .xlsx file

- Import [churn_rates.xlsx](churn_rates.xlsx) and store the data in the form of datafram

- Create visualizations for the churn rate for each variable

- Explore each feature's dependency with churn and create visualization for each

#### :four:    Statistical Testing & Modeling
- Conduct T-Test for categorical variable vs. numerical variable

- Conduct Chi^2 Test for categorical variable vs. categorical variable

- Conclude hypothesis and address the initial questions
#### :five:    Modeling Evaluation
- Create decision tree classifer and fit train dataset

- Find the max depth for the best performing decision tree classifer (evaluated using classification report, accuracy score)

- Create random forest classifier and fit train dataset

- Find the max depth for the best performing random forest classifier (evaluated using classification report, accuracy score)

- Pick the model with highest accuracy and evaluate on test dataset

## :repeat:   Steps to Reproduce
- [x] You will need an **env.py** file that contains the hostname, username and password of the mySQL database that contains the telco table. Store that env file locally in the repository.
- [x] Clone my repo (including the **acquire.py**, **prepare.py** and **churn_rates.xlsx**) 
- [x] Confirm **.gitignore** is hiding your env.py file
- [x] Libraries used are pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, sklearn, scipy
- [x] Follow instructions in [telco_analysis](telco_analysis.ipynb) workbook and README file
- [x] Good to run telco_report :smile_cat:

‚ñ™Ô∏è The top 4 drivers of churn are:

 - electronic payment type
 
 - sernior citizens
 
 - month-to-month contract type
 
 - fiber optic internet service type
    
    
‚ñ™Ô∏è Average **monthly charges** is higher for customers who churn
 
‚ñ™Ô∏è Average **tenure** is shorter for customers who churn
 
‚ñ™Ô∏è Additional services (device protection, online security, online backup, tech support, streaming tv, streaming movies) are dependent on churn

‚ñ™Ô∏è The meachine learning model: logistic regression classifier is expected to predict churn with **81% accuracy** on future unseen data

## :high_brightness:    Recommendations
‚ñ™Ô∏è Raise price of month-to-month contract type and offer discounts for two-year contract to lead customers towards the other two contract types

‚ñ™Ô∏è Offer discount on device protection, streaming tv and streaming movies services

‚ñ™Ô∏è Offer online security, online backup, tech support services for free for one-year and two-year contracts customers

## üîú  Next Steps
‚ñ™Ô∏è Collect more data on customers' **demographic information** (eg. place of residence, socio-economic data such as occupation, household income.)

‚ñ™Ô∏è Develop machine learning models with higher accuracy with these additonal data and more accurate features.

‚ñ™Ô∏è Conduct **price discrimination analysis** to further determine the price point for each contract type and service.
